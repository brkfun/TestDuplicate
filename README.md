## Actually atm i was using rancherOs for better deployment attraction
  
  but for just you i used kustomize for deployment tool it makes everything automated. All i did in gke is create a cluster from ui, 
  after i deployed my actions which is a little complicated if you ask it has pem's and everything that cluster needs.
  it can deploy everything from zero by kustomize you can check it out. Actually normal use, i used 30 minutes of time during this case but 
  i was curious around google cloud so i want to lookup how they managed different from aws kubernetes. Thats why i was that much late.
  
  Have a nice day.
